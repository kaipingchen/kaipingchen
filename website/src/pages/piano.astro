        <h1>Piano: A Lifelong Passion</h1>
        <p>
            Music has been a profound part of my life since I started playing
            piano at the age of three. Performing has taught me courage,
            adaptability, and resilience, whether on stage or in competitions.
            As a teenager, playing in a band showed me that music is not just
            about self-expression but also about listening and
            collaboration—lessons that extend to my academic work.
        </p><p>
            Much like deliberation, music fosters connection and engagement
            across differences. It requires deep listening, responsiveness, and
            shared understanding—skills that parallel effective communication.
            My experiences in piano performance and competitions have shaped how
            I approach challenges with a growth mindset and an openness to new
            perspectives.
        </p><p>
            Recently, I have been exploring how music intersects with science
            and technology communication to create immersive experiences.
            Inspired by projects like Stanford CCRMA and the Princeton Laptop
            Orchestra, I am interested in how emerging technologies shape
            musical expression and engagement, offering new ways to connect with
            audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I continue to explore this space, I look forward to sharing
            performances and interdisciplinary projects. Stay tuned for updates
            on upcoming work!
        </p>
